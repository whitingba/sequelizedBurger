# burger

### Background
This was an assignment for week 14 of the DU Coding Bootcamp. This section of the program was more with Node.js and Express as well as utilizing a SQL database and using an ORM 
(Object Relational Mapper) to query the data in the database. I also learned of the Model View Controller pattern which was utilized in structuring this assignment. The Controller
took in the users request, which were received as HTTP GET OR POST requests. The controller then called upon the model to retrieve the data requested. Last the controller will look
to the view as how this information will be displayed on the screen (from the HTML I provided). The HTML provided in this case was formulated using a popular templating engine,
Handlebars.js.
This assigment was to display an initial list of burgers from my burgers database. There is a button next to each burger in which the burgers can be 'devoured' and they will move 
to the devoured column. There is also funtionality where the user can add their own burger to the list.
